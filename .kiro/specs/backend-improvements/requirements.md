# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature focuses on improving the backend infrastructure of the blog application to make it more robust, maintainable, and production-ready. The improvements include implementing consistent error handling, better validation patterns, comprehensive logging, rate limiting, optimized database configuration, improved testing coverage, pagination support, and proper context usage throughout the application for request tracing and cancellation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent error handling throughout the application, so that errors are predictable and easier to debug.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any error occurs in the system THEN the system SHALL return a standardized error response format with request context
2. WHEN a validation error occurs THEN the system SHALL return specific field-level error messages with context information
3. WHEN a database error occurs THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes with meaningful messages and request tracing
4. WHEN an authentication error occurs THEN the system SHALL return consistent 401/403 responses with context
5. IF an unexpected error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error details with context while returning a generic user-friendly message
6. WHEN request timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL handle context cancellation gracefully

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want validation logic centralized in the service layer with context support, so that validation rules are reusable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN validation is needed THEN the system SHALL perform validation in the service layer with context before business logic
2. WHEN validation fails THEN the system SHALL return detailed validation error messages with request context
3. WHEN creating or updating entities THEN the system SHALL validate all required fields and constraints using context
4. IF validation rules change THEN the system SHALL only require updates in the service layer
5. WHEN multiple endpoints use similar validation THEN the system SHALL reuse validation functions with context support
6. WHEN validation timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL respect context cancellation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive logging throughout the application with context, so that I can monitor system health and debug issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any API request is made THEN the system SHALL log request details with context including method, path, user ID, and request ID
2. WHEN database operations are performed THEN the system SHALL log query execution times and results with context
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log error details with appropriate severity levels and context information
4. WHEN authentication events happen THEN the system SHALL log login attempts and outcomes with user context
5. IF performance issues occur THEN the system SHALL provide sufficient log data with context for analysis
6. WHEN request is cancelled THEN the system SHALL log cancellation events with context

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want rate limiting implemented with context support, so that the API is protected from abuse and maintains performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users make API requests THEN the system SHALL enforce rate limits per IP address with context tracking
2. WHEN rate limits are exceeded THEN the system SHALL return 429 status with retry-after headers and context information
3. WHEN authenticated users make requests THEN the system SHALL apply higher rate limits than anonymous users using context
4. IF rate limiting is triggered THEN the system SHALL log the event for monitoring with request context
5. WHEN rate limits reset THEN the system SHALL allow normal request processing to resume
6. WHEN request context is cancelled THEN the system SHALL handle rate limit cleanup properly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want optimized database connection pooling with context support, so that the application performs efficiently under load.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL configure connection pool with appropriate min/max connections and context timeouts
2. WHEN database connections are needed THEN the system SHALL reuse existing connections from the pool with context
3. WHEN connections are idle THEN the system SHALL close excess connections after timeout
4. IF connection pool is exhausted THEN the system SHALL queue requests with appropriate timeouts using context
5. WHEN monitoring database performance THEN the system SHALL provide connection pool metrics
6. WHEN request context is cancelled THEN the system SHALL cancel database operations gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive unit test coverage with context testing, so that code changes can be made confidently without breaking existing functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is written THEN the system SHALL have unit tests covering all service layer functions with context scenarios
2. WHEN repository functions are implemented THEN the system SHALL have tests covering all CRUD operations with context
3. WHEN utility functions are created THEN the system SHALL have tests covering edge cases, error conditions, and context cancellation
4. IF test coverage drops below 80% THEN the system SHALL fail CI/CD pipeline
5. WHEN tests are run THEN the system SHALL provide coverage reports showing tested and untested code
6. WHEN testing context scenarios THEN the system SHALL verify proper context handling and cancellation

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want pagination support for list endpoints with context, so that I can efficiently retrieve large datasets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting lists of articles THEN the system SHALL support page and limit query parameters with context
2. WHEN pagination is applied THEN the system SHALL return metadata including total count, current page, and total pages
3. WHEN no pagination parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL apply default page size limits
4. IF invalid pagination parameters are provided THEN the system SHALL return validation errors with context
5. WHEN large datasets exist THEN the system SHALL prevent loading all records without pagination
6. WHEN request context is cancelled THEN the system SHALL stop pagination processing gracefully

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want consistent response formats across all endpoints with context information, so that client applications can handle responses predictably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN successful responses are returned THEN the system SHALL use consistent JSON structure with data field and request context
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL return consistent error structure with code, message, and context fields
3. WHEN pagination is used THEN the system SHALL include consistent metadata structure
4. IF additional metadata is needed THEN the system SHALL extend the standard response format consistently
5. WHEN API versions change THEN the system SHALL maintain backward compatibility in response formats
6. WHEN request has context information THEN the system SHALL include relevant context in response headers

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper context usage throughout the application, so that requests can be traced, cancelled, and timed out appropriately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling HTTP requests THEN the system SHALL propagate context through all layers (controller, service, repository)
2. WHEN making database calls THEN the system SHALL use context for query cancellation and timeouts
3. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL include context information like request ID and user ID
4. IF request timeout occurs THEN the system SHALL cancel ongoing operations using context
5. WHEN request is cancelled THEN the system SHALL clean up resources properly using context
6. WHEN tracing requests THEN the system SHALL maintain context chain throughout the request lifecycle
